- Test joining and leaving the room
    - Made some changes here to allow host to leave and re-join the same room
    - also namespacing the host.id with HOST string to simulate host and users in same room
- Test multiple hosts and multiple users (maybe spotify tests app accounts)
- Check performance of the websockets loops and promisses 
- Review the reason we set twice the cross domain headers
- Clean up empty rooms
